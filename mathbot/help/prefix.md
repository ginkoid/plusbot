:::topics prefix

Running `@{{username}} prefix` will simply display the bot's current prefix.

If you are a server admin, `@{{username}} setprefix new_prefix` will set the bot's prefix to `new_prefix` for the server. Use `@{{username}} setprefix =` to reset it to the default value.

In the case you want the prefix have leading or trailing whitespace, `new_prefix` should be wrapped in *backticks* (\` symbols).

Prefix changes are reflected in the help commands when they are run from the server itself.
